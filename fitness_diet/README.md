## üéØ Inspiration

In today's fast-paced world, maintaining a healthy lifestyle is challenging. With the rise of sedentary jobs, processed foods, and limited time for exercise, many people struggle to achieve their fitness goals. We were inspired by the need for accessible, personalized health guidance that leverages cutting-edge AI technology to make healthy living achievable for everyone.

The global obesity epidemic and increasing lifestyle diseases motivated us to create an intelligent system that combines nutrition science, exercise physiology, and machine learning to provide data-driven health recommendations.
